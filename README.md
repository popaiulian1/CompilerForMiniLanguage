# CompilerForMiniLanguage

Small compiler for a mini language. It's a uni project for learning how lexers, parsers, and compilers work.

I have used ANTLR to generate the lexer and parser for the project.
Using C# I collected syntax about the input. (example: global variables, information about each function etc.)
It also signals any errors that the input might have, like a variable being assigned a value that does not match its type or a function that does not exist being called and many more.
